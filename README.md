# Daily-Planner

It's easy to become cluttered and busy when working, so to help ease the clutter I created a daily planner.
You'll be able to set events to the hour. Once that event or hour has passed, the row will turn gray. To add an event just type in the hour it is and hit save! It's that simple!
